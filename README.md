## ðŸš€ Installation

### Using Conda Package

Currently, PyExtal only supports Python 3.11 on Linux. It is tested on WSL2 with Ubuntu 22.02.  

Install using conda (installing in a virtual environment is highly recommended):
```bash
conda install hcni2::pyextal
```

### installing miniconda
If you don't have conda installed, you can install Miniconda by following the instructions at [Miniconda Installation](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).  

To create a new conda environment and install PyExtal, you can use the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n pyextal python=3.11
conda activate pyextal
conda install hcni2::pyextal
```
